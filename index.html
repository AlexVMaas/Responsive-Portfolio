			<h2>About Me</h2>
			<hr />
			<p> <img class="wrapped" src="assets/images/Alex.jpg" width=150px alt="Photo of Alex"> Alex Maas is currently in the process of learning HTML and CSS. As of now, he's alright. Someday he'll be ok. Hopefully before he dies, he'll be good. He's learning because he's always secretly been a little bit of a tech geek, but kind of a closet tech geek. He's stood by and watched other people have fun creating stuff, and by George, he's tired of it. So this is his Sgt. Pepper. This is his magnum opus. This...webpage...here.</p>
			
			<br />

			<p>He hopes to take these skills and build fun stuff with them. He's a recent graduate of the University of Colorado-Boulder school of business. His capstone project was a platform-type business and he's hoping to meet other adventurous people with experience in tech development. This is his chance, and he's gonna take it.</p>
